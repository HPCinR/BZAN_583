DEV NOTES

Sources:
* go-ski/ASwR
* go-ski/pics - is a pictures repository shared by BZAN_583 and by HPCinR_book. GO repo clone has more

TODO:

* Create a new github organization for the class
* Make the class repo a github website in that organization
* Get the website URL into Canvas

* Make the repo a tamplate repository so that forks do not include history
  * commits to a fork do not count but to cloned templates they do count

* Looks like GitHub classroom connection to Canvas is an Admin job
  * Is it possible that no UTK class has yet been connected?

* move book to RBigData as well
