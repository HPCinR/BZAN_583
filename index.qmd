title: "HPC for Data Science in R - BZAN 583"
editor: source
---

This course is intended to provide an ability to use modern HPC systems for data science with R, provide some understanding of computational and large data issues that arise in statistical and machine learning and their potential solutions, and give some practice of these skills on a modern HPC cluster system. See Syllabus link above for additional details.

It is the first time this course has been offered so there will be some rough edges and some material provided "just in time." Much of the material was recently presented in data science and HPC conference tutorials and is being adapted to this half-semester course. I welcome any suggestions and corrections to improve the material. 

**Material below Week 1 is under construction!**
