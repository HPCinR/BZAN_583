title: "HPC for Data Science in R - BZAN 583"
---

This course will provide an ability to use modern HPC systems for data science, provide some understanding of issues that arise with large data sets in machine learning and potential solutions, some practice of these skills to analyze large data in business applications.

It is the first time this has been offered so there will be some rough edges. This means that I will work with you when some things break and I also hope that you will work with me to improve the course for future iterations.
