Each Team has chosen a data set for their project. This assignment is to jump start the projects so that each team has a working and fast-readable data set on Delta by the end of this week.

There are team directories `Team1` through `Team6` on the Delta `/project/bckj` file system. 

**Result1:** Download your data set to your `/projects/bckj/Team#` directory, into a subdirectory to keep things organized.

**Result2:** Convert your data set into a `parquet` format, partitioned by a well chosen variable, using the **arrow** package and write it to another subdirectory under `/projects/bckj/Team#`. Good partition size is somewhere between 100 and 500 MB per 

**Result3:** Get the sizes of each of the two directories with `du -hs <directory>` and submit the text result of these commands and their output.

The only output to hand in to Canvas are the four lines of Result 3. Of course, the data directories on Delta need to contain the data reported by Result3.
