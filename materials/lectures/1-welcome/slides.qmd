::: notes
* Welcome!!
* thx for signing up for the class!

- **Welcome!!**  Overview & Syllabus
- **Assign groups of 3-4**  
- **Survey and expectations**  
- **Start setting up accounts (GitHub, Delta cluster)  -Assignment**  
- **Introduction to workflow: RStudio to remote cluster via GitHub**   

## Random Group Assignment {.smaller}

#### Class divided into groups of 3 to 4  
- Assigned randomly via Canvas  
- Swapping is allowed (after class today) if all members of concerned groups agree

#### Handout
- Group assignments on the front  
- Survey on the back  
  - Fill out now  
  - Will collect at end of class today  

## Survey {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}

-  Your laptop: [Unix, Mac, Windows]{style="color:blue;"}  
- R experience:  [used in a class, used in two classes, x years, wrote an R package, live and breathe R]{style="color:blue;"}  
- Use RStudio?  [usually, all the time, reluctantly, prefer Jupyter]{style="color:blue;"}
- Other programming languages: [Python, C, C++, Go, ...]{style="color:blue;"}  
- Use git?  [what's that?, heard of it, tried it once, use it often, I live on it]{style="color:blue;"}
- R parallel package?  [what's that?, heard of it, tried it once, didn't help me, got great results, keeps all the cores busy on my laptop]{style="color:blue;"}

## Survey ... continued {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}

- Unix experince (Linux, MacOS terminal): [never used it, tried it once, know a few commands, I write shell scripts]{style="color:blue;"}
- HPC Cluster? [I know they exist, saw one, logged in once, used one for a project, keep one in my basement]{style="color:blue;"}
- Cloud computing? [is it real?, heard about it, MS Azure, AWS, UTK cluster VM, Other]{style="color:blue;"}
- MPI?  [what's that?, heard of it, used a code that used it, wrote some code]{style="color:blue;"}
- Torch or LLM experience? [a few words]{style="color:blue;"}
- Your expectations for this class: [play with HPC, Build an HPC Analytics Startup Co]{style="color:blue;"}
