TODO:

* Create a new github organization for the class
* Make the class repo a github website in that organization
* Get the website URL into Canvas

* Make the repo a tamplate repository so that forks do not include history
  * commits to a fork do not count but to cloned templates they do count

* Looks like GitHub classroom connection to Canvas is an Admin job
  * Is it possible that no UTK class has yet been connected?

* move book to RBigData as well

UPDATE
* https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-hpc/2022-August/002144.html directions
  * `export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOMEBREW_CELLAR/openblas:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`
