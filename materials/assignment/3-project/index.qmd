title: "Assignment 3: Project Proposals"
editor: source
---

This assignment is the first to be completed, turned in, and graded by groups.

The proposal should include (1) a large data set (2) a description of what will be studied, tested, or predicted, (3) a description of the ML methodologies expected to be used.

Groups are encouraged to meet on their own one or more times before discussing the proposal with the instructor.

Each group will set up a 30 minute meeting time with the Instructor during this week to discuss their proposed project.

Various times to meet are available on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of this week. Suggest two possible time slots so I have some leeway of consolidating.

An approved proposal gets the full 12 points for each group member.
