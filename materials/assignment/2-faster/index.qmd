title: "Week 2 Assignment: Faster"
editor: source
---
**Still under development ...**

Find some R code that YOU put together for a prior assignment or project in another class over the last year or two, profile it, and make changes that make it at least 2x faster. This can be a single function from a larger code but it should not be just trivial. Roughly 10 to 20 lines of your R code that originally takes more than, say, 30 seconds to run.

This is your video game! When you get things 2x faster, you just beat the game and you move up a level!

**Result 1:** Two or three sentences that describe where the code was used originally and its purpose. The intent is documentation that this is YOUR R code and to give me some understanding of the code.  

**Result 2:** The code, its summary profile with 10 top components, and the `system.time()` of the code "before".  

**Result 3:** The code, its summary profile with 10 top components, and the `system.time()` of the code "after".   

**Result 4:** Two or three sentences that explain your changes and why things got faster.
