## GitHub Copilot {.smaller}

RStudio now has a [Copilot option](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html)

Free to students and academics ($20/month otherwise - says Copilot, but I think it's $10)

::: {.incremental}
- This slide is being written with Copilot on
- It's a bit like a smart autocomplete
- Above, it suggested a non-existent link for the Copilot option
- It's better than autocomplete in RStudio
- But I find it unhelpful for HPC facing R code
- It does a little better with shell scripts

::: notes
- Experiments with GPT 3.5 
- R is mostly laptop
  - parallel suggestions are mostly laptop oriented
- Planned demo with rf-serial into rf_mc
  - failed to get it to work

## Torch, Pytorch, and **torch** {.smaller}

- Torch is a C++ library that provides neural network and optimization routines that work with tensors (multi-dimensional arrays)

::: {.incremental}
- Pytorch is a deep learning library for Python that is based on the Torch library
- **torch** is a package for R that provides an interface to the Torch library
  - Takes about 15 minutes to install on Delta
    - Still working out what modules are needed
  - Copilot: I have a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q1JZQ1J0Zo) on how to install it
  - Copilot: Copilot is wrong, but I do have a video on how to install it (Not)
  - A book: [Deep Learning and Scientific Computing with R torch](https://skeydan.github.io/deep-learning-and-scientific-computing-with-r-torch/)
