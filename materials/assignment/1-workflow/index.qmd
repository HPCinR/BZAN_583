## Setup your NCSA Delta Account

<!--
Instructor notes for adding Delta users to allocated project:  
See "Adding account holders to a group or project" on [Delta Webpage](https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/USSPPRT/NCSA+Allocation+and+Account+Management) for general directions.

Specifically, see "Inviting new people to your project" for information on inviting persons who do not have an NCSA account.
-->

Expect to receive an email from the instructor with the subject: "NCSA Delta Account for BZAN 583" it will contain a link to account registration and login. Let the instructor know if you did not receive one by the first class meeting.

Following the link will open a login webpage:

  ![](/pics/login/ncsa.png)

Use the green "Register New User and Join" link to set up your NCSA Delta account. If you don't see the "Register ..." link, clearing your browser cookies should bring it back.

Follow the registration and login instructions. Your login setup can use UTK's 2-factor authentication via DUO. 

After setting up your account, your instructor will add you to join the class computing allocation. 

When you have access, login via ssh to  `<your-delta-username>@login.delta.ncsa.illinois.edu`. This will request your password and ask whether to do a DUO push to your mobile phone. Below is an example with your instructor's username login from a Mac Terminal shell. Only the first line is an interaction with the Mac shell (% prompt) and the rest is coming from the Delta login node ($ prompt).
```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

ost@GO ~ % ssh gostrouc@login.delta.ncsa.illinois.edu

NCSA Delta System

Login with NCSA Kerberos + NCSA Duo multi-factor.

DUO Documentation:  https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa

gostrouc@login.delta.ncsa.illinois.edu's password: 
(gostrouc@login.delta.ncsa.illinois.edu) Duo two-factor login for gostrouc

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1037

Last failed login: Mon Mar 18 18:54:12 CDT 2024 from 73.121.22.186 on ssh:notty
There was 1 failed login attempt since the last successful login.
[gostrouc@dt-login02 ~]$ 
```
Delta user assistance tells me to ignore the "1 failed login" message.

Troubleshooting your login-node login can be done via the  [Identity](https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/login) web page, with the same login credentials.

If you still need login help, email `help@ncsa.illinois.edu`.

**Result 1:** Turn in a copy of your session running the following shell commands in the sequence given on a Delta login node.  The intent here is to verify that you can successfully connect to a Delta login node and run a few basic Unix commands.

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

hostname
date
w
whoami
ls
pwd
mkdir R
ls
ls -a
ls -la
ls -laF --color
cd R
pwd
cd
pwd
module load r
module list
Rscript -e "sessionInfo()"
```
**Result 2:** Use the `man` command to get a description of what each command does. Use `man man` to get an explanation of the `man` command. Turn in a short one-sentence description for each unique command. 

**Result 3:** From GitHub ... your GitHub user id. So I can invite you to the BZAN-583 team in the HPCinR organization.
